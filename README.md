  ## General Requirements

To run the codes, you'll need the following dependencies:
- ROS2 (Only for visualization)
- Numpy
- Jax-Numpy (https://github.com/google/jax)
- Ubuntu
- Scipy
- RVO2, Download the version that is in 3d and in C++ (https://gamma.cs.unc.edu/RVO2/)

 ## Running the codes 

 - To obtain the waypoints, please refer to our previous work, (https://github.com/arunkumar-singh/GPU-Multi-Agent-Traj-Opt), follow the readme, and save the waypoints as .npy
 - Run main_local_planner.py for each configuration.
 - Visualization has been done using ROS2 in RVIZ.

Codes will be updated soon
