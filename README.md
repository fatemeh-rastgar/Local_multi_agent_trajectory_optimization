  ## General Requirements

To run the codes, you'll need the following dependencies:
- ROS2 (Only for visualization)
- Numpy
- Jax-Numpy (https://github.com/google/jax)
- Ubuntu
- Scipy

 ## Running the codes 

 - To obtain the waypoints, please refer to our previous work, \url{https://github.com/arunkumar-singh/GPU-Multi-Agent-Traj-Opt}, follow the read me, and save the waypoints as .npy
 - 

Codes will be updated soon
